# About the blank lines in the notebook

We notice that the notebook contains many blank lines in each cell, which is not shown either in our local notebook or on Google Colab. We assume that this is because of some issues with GitHub displaying the notebook (Character Encoding!). If you have further questions, please send an email to yitao.xu@epfl.ch and we can show a correct version of the notebook.

# 02 - Regression Observational Studies Stats and Supervised Learning

In this homework, you will work with two popular frameworks: (1) *[sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)* (short for scikit-learn) and (2) *[statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/)*. In addition, you will create some basic visualizations to explain your findings. Regression analysis and Supervised learning constitute the two quintessential skills for a data scientist, thereby serving as the perfect material to prepare you for the real world.

The homework tasks are described in the `hw2.ipynb` notebook.

For each task, please provide *both* a written explanation of the steps you followed, and the corresponding code. 
Keep in mind that writing the explanation can help you in two ways:
1. Clarifying the steps in your mind before writing the actual code
2. Earning you points if the description is correct, regardless of the potential issues in your code

### Deliverables
1. `hw2.ipynb` notebook with disclosed output for each cell. **Please don't update the `data` folder provided in the repository, i.e., use it in read-only mode.**

#### Deadline: December 2nd, 23:59
